## Introduction
This pipeline is written specifically for the analysis of data originating from our Oxford Nanopore Technologies-based mRNA sequencing protocol. It is tuned towards a faithful quantification of different isoforms (including novel ones). The pipeline uses a Docker image which is pulled from Docker Hub, when run with the ```docker``` profile. A general overview of the pipeline is visualized in the following flowchart:
